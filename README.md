# Monument-Maze
Another Free Unity Roll a Ball Game Template

Watch the demo video here: https://youtu.be/-INGO7wkOI4

Based on Unity official Roll a Ball tutorial, I've made this maze kind game. The goal is to bring the game to the goal area, which is a monument at the end of the maze (or center sometimes).

You can control the ball's movement using on-screen virtual joystick in this game, which is suitable for mobile devices.

AdMob plugin is also available inside it, so you can just insert your ad codes.

Don't forget to add all necessary scenes to the game's build.
